NVIDIA GPUs: option to **reimplement custom code using CUDA**. \n            ![](/assets/images/2020-11-20-11-52-23.png)\n        - this is hard to do w ASIC \n- Target throughput, latency and cost: \n    - **GPUs** are throughput processors \n        - If latency is not critical, GPU utilization can be kept high and cost low - great for batch processing & offline inference\n        - if you are unable to keep your GPU utilization at its maximum at all times, due to e.g. sporadic inference request, cost / inference request goes up \n            - better to use **Amazon Elastic Inference** which lets you access just enough GPU acceleration for lower cost.\n\n    - CPUs are not parallel, but may be better for realtime inference of smaller models as long as latency is acceptable\n    - Inferentia’s performance and lower cost could be most cost effective and performant option if model is fully supported \n- Compiler and runtime toolchain and ease of use\n    - GPU:\n        - deep learning framework is good but not optimized\n        - use a dedicated inference compiler such as NVIDIA TensorRT for up to 10x speedup \n            - Quantization: reduce precision - from FP32 -> FR16 or INT8\n            - Graph fusion: fusing multiple layers/ops into a single function call\n\n### AWS Inferentia\n- precisions:\n    - automatically cast your FP32 model to BF16 \n    - or can provide model in FP16 \n- increase performance by:\n    - batching: reducing cost of loading weights for each layer from external memory for each input\n    - pipelining: load weights of different subgraphs on different NeuronCores\n    - both require setting options during compilation \n- Using all NeuronCores on your Inf1 instances: \n    - smallest instance type: inf1.xlarge automatically perform data parallel execution on all 4 NeuronCores (=replicating your model 4 times and loading it into each NeuronCore and running 4 Python threads to feed input to data to each core)\n    - larger instance: must spawn multiple threads and use python threadpools \n- divide NeuronCores to run different models\n\n### Amazon Elastic Inference\nAttached through the network using an AWS PrivateLink\n\nWhy choose Amazon EI over dedicated GPU instances?\n- if don’t have sufficient demand or multiple models to serve and share the GPU to keep up utilization, can attach \"just enough\" GPU acceleration to a CPU instance\n- The cost of the CPU instance + EI accelerator would still be cheaper than a dedicated GPU instance\n- EI adds some latency compared to GPU instance, but can be faster than CPU only \n- need to use an EI enabled framework such as TensorFlow, PyTorch or Apache MXNet\n\n\n## [Choosing the right GPU for deep learning on AWS](https://towardsdatascience.com/choosing-the-right-gpu-for-deep-learning-on-aws-d69c157d8c86)\n\n- G4 instance: NVIDIA T4 GPUs \n    -

Decoding logic needs hardcoding\n\n### Binary format\n\n- Benefits \n    - More compact (JSON etc. needs to be self describing. Lots of space used in each record)\n\t- The **schema is a valuable form of documentation**  \n\t- **Keeping a database of schemas** allows you to check forward and backward compatibility of schema changes, before anything is deployed. \n    - **Code gen for static typed languages**\n- **Apach Thrift** (originally Facebook) and **ProtoBuf** (ori.

In Avro code gen is optional - for dynamic type, can read directly\n\n#### The Merits of Schemas \n\n- Many DBs proprietary binary encoding: JDBC/ODBC driver can decode responses from the DBs’s network protocol into in-memory data structures. \n- Thrift, Protobuf and Avro all support schema, but simpler than XML or json (e.g. regex constraints)\n\n## Modes of dataflow\n\n### Through Databases \n\n- Backward compatibility is clearly necessary: same client, newer version needs to read older writes\n- Forward compatibility is also needed: newer client writes a record, a older client reads\n- Common error: newer client adds a field, older client update the row, that unknown field get dropped-- if it can't parse new field, should keep as-is \n- Data outlives code: App updates fast. Data from a long time ago is still stored \n\t- Schema evolution thus allows the entire database to appear as if it was encoded with a single schema, even though the underlying storage may contain records encoded with various historical versions of the schema. \n- Archival storage:\n\t- data dump will typically be encoded using the latest schema \n\t- Avro object container often good fit - or parquet for analytic friendliness \n\n### Through Services: REST and RPC \n\n- REST is not a protocol, but rather a design philosophy that builds upon the principles of HTTP - \"REST-ful\"\n    - URL as resource\n    - HTTP features for cache control, authentication, and content type negotiation \n    - it doesn’t try to hide the fact that it’s a network protocol\n- SOAP: \n    - avoid HTTP specific features\n    - WSDL enables code generation so that a client can access a remote service using local classes and method calls  - not as useful for dynamically typed languages\n- problems with RPCs pretending to be local calls - is flawed idea: \n    - Unpredictable, may require retry\n    - may not know whether succeeded or failed (in case of timeout) \n    - Retry and idempotence - request may be going through but didn't get successful response\n    - Latency longer\n    - Passing data\n- REST is usually used for external comm, RPC may be internal\n- Evolution:\n    - can assume all the servers will be updated first, and all the clients second -> only need backward compatibility on requests, and forward compatibility on responses. \n\t- REST api provider can store client APIs + version they are requesting to help manage. E.g. [stripe](https://stripe.com/docs/upgrades)\n    - Thrift, gRPC (Protocol Buffers), and Avro RPC can be evolved according to the compatibility rules of the respective encoding format\n\n### Message-Passing Dataflow \n- **Actor programming model**: communicates by send/receiving async messages. process one message at a time. assume message may be lost \n- Compared to RPC, less mismatch between local vs remote communication \n- example distributed actor frameworks: message broker + actor programming model\n    * Akka - Java’s built-in serialization by default -> no fw/bw compatibility. supports using with ProtoBuf etc. to do rolling upgrades\n    * Orleans - also support custom serailization plug-ins \n    * Erlang OTP  \n","url":"https://angelarwang.com/dendron-notes/notes/e22dd5a3-f940-4548-b1d7-22a26b5386ce.html","relUrl":"notes/e22dd5a3-f940-4548-b1d7-22a26b5386ce.html"},{"doc":"Ch03 - Storage and Retrieval","title":"Ch03 - Storage and Retrieval","hpath":"books.tech.data-intensive-applications.ch3-DB-storage","content":"\n# Chapter 3: Storage and retrieval\n## Data structures that power your DB \n### Hash indexes \n- Use log for writing key + value; key + value\n- Index: Key -> byte offsets mapping \n- Used by - Bitcask - default storage engine for Riak - hashmap stored in memory \n- Good for: value of each key is updated frequently \n- Log compaction:\n    ![](/assets/images/2020-11-02-12-51-46.png)\n\n    - Segment log files\n    - Keep only the most recent update for each key \n    - Merging and compaction is written to a new file - in background \n    ![](/assets/images/2020-11-02-12-57-10.png)\n    - After compaction, switch to new merged segment \n- Lookup: each segment has its own hash table.

object \n        -  Predicate used for both property and edges\n            \n            ```\n            - prefix : \\<urn:example:\\>.\n                _:lucy     a       :Person.\n                _:lucy     :name   \"Lucy\".\n                _:lucy     :bornIn _:idaho\n            ```\n- Query language:\n    - Declarative:\n        -  SparQL - for triple stores using the RDF data model\n        -  Datalog - predicate(subject, object) - build rules small steps at a time \n        -  Cypher - neo4j \n    - Imperative: \n        -  Gremlin\n\n## Summary\n- Historically, data started out being represented as one big tree (the hierarchical model), but that wasn’t good for representing many-to-many relationships, so the relational model was invented to solve that problem \n- Recently noSQL:\n    - Document - when relationships across docs is rare\n    - Graph  - when anything is related to anything \n\t\t\n","url":"https://angelarwang.com/dendron-notes/notes/45199987-a515-40d0-8bc8-c447503f21b1.html","relUrl":"notes/45199987-a515-40d0-8bc8-c447503f21b1.html"},{"doc":"Ch10 -

**Chain of commands** versus custom program \n        - Sorting vs in-memory aggregation: example - count the most frequent URLs \n            - if large amount of data, sorting can make efficient use of disks \n                -
