AWS Inferentia - fixed set of supported operations exposed via AWS Neuron SDK compiler \r\n    - CPU - fully programmable\r\n    - GPU - in between \r\n    - if have custom code written in high level languages, fall back to CPU:\r\n        ![](/assets/images/2020-11-20-11-31-03.png)\r\n        - NVIDIA GPUs: option to **reimplement custom code using CUDA**. \r\n            ![](/assets/images/2020-11-20-11-52-23.png)\r\n        - this is hard to do w ASIC \r\n- Target throughput, latency and cost: \r\n    - **GPUs** are throughput processors \r\n        - If latency is not critical, GPU utilization can be kept high and cost low - great for batch processing & offline inference\r\n        - if you are unable to keep your GPU utilization at its maximum at all times, due to e.g. sporadic inference request, cost / inference request goes up \r\n            - better to use **Amazon Elastic Inference** which lets you access just enough GPU acceleration for lower cost.\r\n\r\n    - CPUs are not parallel, but may be better for realtime inference of smaller models as long as latency is acceptable\r\n    - Inferentia’s performance and lower cost could be most cost effective and performant option if model is fully supported \r\n- Compiler and runtime toolchain and ease of use\r\n    - GPU:\r\n        - deep learning framework is good but not optimized\r\n        - use a dedicated inference compiler such as NVIDIA TensorRT for up to 10x speedup \r\n            - Quantization: reduce precision - from FP32 -> FR16 or INT8\r\n            - Graph fusion: fusing multiple layers/ops into a single function call\r\n\r\n### AWS Inferentia\r\n- precisions:\r\n    - automatically cast your FP32 model to BF16 \r\n    - or can provide model in FP16 \r\n- increase performance by:\r\n    - batching: reducing cost of loading weights for each layer from external memory for each input\r\n    - pipelining: load weights of different subgraphs on different NeuronCores\r\n    - both require setting options during compilation \r\n- Using all NeuronCores on your Inf1 instances: \r\n    - smallest instance type: inf1.xlarge automatically perform data parallel execution on all 4 NeuronCores (=replicating your model 4 times and loading it into each NeuronCore and running 4 Python threads to feed input to data to each core)\r\n    - larger instance: must spawn multiple threads and use python threadpools \r\n- divide NeuronCores to run different models\r\n\r\n### Amazon Elastic Inference\r\nAttached through the network using an AWS PrivateLink\r\n\r\nWhy choose Amazon EI over dedicated GPU instances?\r\n- if don’t have sufficient demand or multiple models to serve and share the GPU to keep up utilization, can attach \"just enough\" GPU acceleration to a CPU instance\r\n- The cost of the CPU instance + EI accelerator would still be cheaper than a dedicated GPU instance\r\n- EI adds some latency compared to GPU instance, but can be faster than CPU only \r\n- need to use an EI enabled framework such as TensorFlow, PyTorch or Apache MXNet\r\n\r\n\r\n## [Choosing the right GPU for deep learning on AWS](https://towardsdatascience.com/choosing-the-right-gpu-for-deep-learning-on-aws-d69c157d8c86)\r\n\r\n- G4 instance: NVIDIA T4 GPUs \r\n    -

Decoding logic needs hardcoding\r\n\r\n### Binary format\r\n\r\n- Benefits \r\n    - More compact (JSON etc. needs to be self describing. Lots of space used in each record)\r\n\t- The **schema is a valuable form of documentation**  \r\n\t- **Keeping a database of schemas** allows you to check forward and backward compatibility of schema changes, before anything is deployed. \r\n    - **Code gen for static typed languages**\r\n- **Apach Thrift** (originally Facebook) and **ProtoBuf** (ori. Google)\r\n    - example Protobuf schema\r\n        \r\n        ```\r\n\t\tmessage Person {\r\n            required string user_name       = 1;\r\n            optional int64  favorite_number = 2;\r\n            repeated string interests       = 3;\r\n\t\t} \r\n        ```\r\n    - Field tags and schema evolution \r\n        - Each field contain the tag number and value\r\n        - Tag number can't change\r\n        - Protobuf has no list type, but `repeated` flag - can evolve from single to repeated \r\n        - Thrift has dedicated list type => supports nested lists\r\n- **Avro** - designed for hadoop\r\n    - No reference to field tag\r\n    - Record appear in order\r\n    - **Translate between The writer’s schema and the reader’s schema**\r\n    - To maintain compatibility, you must only add or remove a field that has a **default value** \r\n    - how to find writer schema: different options \r\n        - Large file with lots of records  - include the writer’s schema once at the beginning of the large  file \r\n        - Version number + database to look up schema\r\n        - Negotiate version on connection setup - AVRO RPC \r\n    - Benefit: \r\n        - Support dynamically generated schemas  - e.g. no need to hardcode translation between DB columns and schema if doing a dump\r\n        - Code generation and dynamically typed languages - Thrift and Protocol Buffers rely on code generation, not great for dynamic lang. In Avro code gen is optional - for dynamic type, can read directly\r\n\r\n#### The Merits of Schemas \r\n\r\n- Many DBs proprietary binary encoding: JDBC/ODBC driver can decode responses from the DBs’s network protocol into in-memory data structures. \r\n- Thrift, Protobuf and Avro all support schema, but simpler than XML or json (e.g. regex constraints)\r\n\r\n## Modes of dataflow\r\n\r\n### Through Databases \r\n\r\n- Backward compatibility is clearly necessary: same client, newer version needs to read older writes\r\n- Forward compatibility is also needed: newer client writes a record, a older client reads\r\n- Common error: newer client adds a field, older client update the row, that unknown field get dropped-- if it can't parse new field, should keep as-is \r\n- Data outlives code: App updates fast. Data from a long time ago is still stored \r\n\t- Schema evolution thus allows the entire database to appear as if it was encoded with a single schema, even though the underlying storage may contain records encoded with various historical versions of the schema. \r\n- Archival storage:\r\n\t- data dump will typically be encoded using the latest schema \r\n\t- Avro object container often good fit - or parquet for analytic friendliness \r\n\r\n### Through Services: REST and RPC \r\n\r\n- REST is not a protocol, but rather a design philosophy that builds upon the principles of HTTP - \"REST-ful\"\r\n    - URL as resource\r\n    - HTTP features for cache control, authentication, and content type negotiation \r\n    - it doesn’t try to hide the fact that it’s a network protocol\r\n- SOAP: \r\n    - avoid HTTP specific features\r\n    - WSDL enables code generation so that a client can access a remote service using local classes and method calls  - not as useful for dynamically typed languages\r\n- problems with RPCs pretending to be local calls - is flawed idea: \r\n    - Unpredictable, may require retry\r\n    - may not know whether succeeded or failed (in case of timeout) \r\n    - Retry and idempotence - request may be going through but didn't get successful response\r\n    - Latency longer\r\n    - Passing data\r\n- REST is usually used for external comm, RPC may be internal\r\n- Evolution:\r\n    - can assume all the servers will be updated first, and all the clients second -> only need backward compatibility on requests, and forward compatibility on responses. \r\n\t- REST api provider can store client APIs + version they are requesting to help manage. E.g. [stripe](https://stripe.com/docs/upgrades)\r\n    - Thrift, gRPC (Protocol Buffers), and Avro RPC can be evolved according to the compatibility rules of the respective encoding format\r\n\r\n### Message-Passing Dataflow \r\n- **Actor programming model**: communicates by send/receiving async messages. process one message at a time. assume message may be lost \r\n- Compared to RPC, less mismatch between local vs remote communication \r\n- example distributed actor frameworks: message broker + actor programming model\r\n    * Akka - Java’s built-in serialization by default -> no fw/bw compatibility. supports using with ProtoBuf etc. to do rolling upgrades\r\n    * Orleans - also support custom serailization plug-ins \r\n    * Erlang OTP  \r\n","url":"https://angelarwang.com/dendron-notes/notes/e22dd5a3-f940-4548-b1d7-22a26b5386ce.html","relUrl":"notes/e22dd5a3-f940-4548-b1d7-22a26b5386ce.html"},{"doc":"Ch03 - Storage and Retrieval","title":"Ch03 - Storage and Retrieval","hpath":"books.tech.data-intensive-applications.ch3-DB-storage","content":"\r\n# Chapter 3: Storage and retrieval\r\n## Data structures that power your DB \r\n### Hash indexes \r\n- Use log for writing key + value; key + value\r\n- Index: Key -> byte offsets mapping \r\n- Used by - Bitcask - default storage engine for Riak - hashmap stored in memory \r\n- Good for: value of each key is updated frequently \r\n- Log compaction:\r\n    ![](/assets/images/2020-11-02-12-51-46.png)\r\n\r\n    - Segment log files\r\n    - Keep only the most recent update for each key \r\n    - Merging and compaction is written to a new file - in background \r\n    ![](/assets/images/2020-11-02-12-57-10.png)\r\n    - After compaction, switch to new merged segment \r\n- Lookup: each segment has its own hash table.
