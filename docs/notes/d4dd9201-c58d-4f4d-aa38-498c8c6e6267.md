# Survival analysis

- Censoring: [Video: Survival Analysis Part 1 - What is Censoring?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX3l36ptrTU)

  - **Assume**: censoring is non-informative - being censored or not is not related to the probablity of event happening

- [Video: Survival Analysis Part 2 - Survival Function, Hazard, & Hazard Ratio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdmWdIV5k-I)
  - **Survival function**: S(t) = P(T>t) = prob. of survival beyond time t
  - **Hazard**: HAZ = P(T&lt; t + dt | T >t)
           = prob of dying in next few seconds, given alive now
  - **Hazard ratio** (HR)  , prob of dying in next few seconds given exposure vs. not 

      \\(  HR = {HAZ, x=1 \\over HAZ, x=0} \\)
