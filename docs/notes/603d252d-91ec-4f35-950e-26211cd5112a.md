purpose of transactions: simplify the programming model

## ACID definition is slippery

- Atomicity:
  - different from normal meaning in concurrency programming (nobody else sees a partially updated state)
  - means more _abortability_ - when  failure, all partial updates are reverted 
- Consistency: 
  - overloaded term
  - means some _invariants_ to be true - but it's more up to application. 
  - 'C' doesn't really belong
- Isolation:
  - concurrently executing transactions are isolated from each other: they cannot step on each other’s toes
  - i.e. _serializability_ - result is the same as if they had run serially
  - in practice, **strictly serializable isolation is rarely used**. Oracle 11g doesn’t even implement it.
