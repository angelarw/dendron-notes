### Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)

Excess return of a stock is proportional to its beta 
 ![](/dendron-notes/assets/images/2020-12-19-14-39-00.png)

 \\( \\beta \\): covariance - systemtic risk - sensitivity to the market

- \\( \\beta \\) = 1, stock moves with the market exactly
- \\( \\beta \\) > 1, stock amplifies market
- 0 &lt; \\( \\beta \\) &lt; 1, goes with market, but less so, e.g. Walmart 

Stadard deviation (\\(\\sigma\\)): measure of total risk  

CAPM: assets with higher \\( \\beta \\) should have higher benchmarks. Can't sipmly compare returns of assets. Prices and expected returns should reflect how sensitive it is to overall market 

Alpha (\\(\\alpha)\\): performance of an asset relative to its CAPM predicte return.
