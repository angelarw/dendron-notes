## Methods of Communication in the Brain

- reticular 网状 theory (Golgi)
  - connected reticular net 
- neuron doctrine
  - neurons are independent, contigual not continual 
- types:
  - sensory neuron - external stimuli -> electrical signals
  - interneuron - processing & relay
  - motor neuron - electrical signals-> muscle or gland movement
- ion channels & ion pumps 
  - ![](/assets/images/2021-09-09-12-54-33.png)
  1. influx of Ca++ -> synaptic vesicles fuse with pre-synaptic membrane
  1. transmitter released into cleft
  1. transmitter binds receptor molecules on post-synaptic membrane
  1. post-synaptic channels then open/close based on binding
  1. opneing -> influx of ions (Na+/K+) / close -> prevents
  1. causes either depolarize or hyper-polarize 
  1. if post-synaptic voltage large enough -> electrochemical pual is generated = action potential
  1. simultaneously
      - action potential travels down axon. 
      - used vesicle is retrieved and recycled
  1. new transmitter is synthesized 

  - ![](/assets/images/2021-09-09-12-55-57.png)
  - Excitatory post-synaptic potential (EPSP)
    - sometimes sum of EPSPs from multiple neuros are necessary for action potential

### Basics of MRI

- MRI signal
  - spin both its own axis and the magnetic field
    ![](/assets/images/2021-09-20-21-39-02.png)
    - parallel: low energy
    - anti-parallel: high energy 
  - after a few seconds, reach equilibrium, all protons are aligned 
  - static field can't be measured. MRI signal introduces different direction perpendicular to the main field, causes protons to move away from axis
    ![](/assets/images/2021-09-20-22-16-11.png)
    - when stops, procession back to original alignment
    - t1 & t2 plane
      - t1: longitutional (original field position)
        ![](/assets/images/2021-09-20-22-14-26.png)
      - t2: transverse
      ![](/assets/images/2021-09-20-22-10-11.png)
    - the procession induces a signal in receiver coil
    - relaxation time: time it takes to recover after being disturbed 
    - different biological matter have different but consistent t1 and t2 relaxation times
      ![](/assets/images/2021-09-20-22-12-11.png)
      - tumor also different 
      ![](/assets/images/2021-09-20-22-12-29.png)
    - ![](/assets/images/2021-09-20-22-13-24.png)
  - spatial specificity 
    - **Larmor frequency** frequeny needed to changea spin from low to high energy spin 
      ![](/assets/images/2021-09-20-22-17-44.png)
      ![](/assets/images/2021-09-20-22-18-02.png)
      - MRI mostly targeting water molecules
    - Larmor frequency depends on local magnetic strength
    - create bands of frequency/magnetic gradient 
    - put together:
      - linear gradients create sptial specificity
      - radio purlse selectively excites slices
      ![](/assets/images/2021-09-20-22-25-17.png)
- fMRI 
  - ![](/assets/images/2021-09-20-22-29-29.png)
  - oxygenated hemoglobin vs de-O hemoglobin have different effects on dephasing - de-O hemoglobin cause more dephasing 
    ![](/assets/images/2021-09-20-22-31-19.png)
  - Blood Oxygen Level Dependent (BOLD) MRI 
  - measure changes in homogeneity in magnetic field (T2*)
    - T2: transverse magnetization decay of a spin after radio frequency pulse
    - T2*: transverse magnetization decay from local magnetic field variations
    - ![](/assets/images/2021-09-20-22-36-34.png)
    - de-O hemoglobin: paramagnetic, introduces inhomogeneity
    - O hemoglobin: little effect 
  - BOLD signal:
    - HRF: hemodynamic response function  
    ![](/assets/images/2021-09-20-22-41-50.png)
    - it doesn't measure neural activity directly
    - measures metabolic demands
  - physiological basis:
    ![](/assets/images/2021-09-20-22-44-12.png)
    1. glutamate releases 
    1. open post-synaptic ion channels
    1. re-uptake of glutamate by astrocyte triggers glucose metabolism
    1. astrocytes pump out ions to restor ionic gradients
    1. processes use glucose + O2
    - MUA- multi-unit activity
    - LFP local field potential = summation of post-synaptic potential more correlated (but delayed) w BOLD activity

## MRI studies
- structural 
  - qualitative eval
    - ![](/assets/images/2021-09-20-23-00-51.png)
  - volumetric analysis:
    - count voxels -> difference of volume of various parts compared to controls 
    - automatic segmentation
  - analyze cortical thickness

  - strutural morphology: compare shape differences
    ![](/assets/images/2021-09-21-19-46-04.png)

  - example of correlating behavioral w structual analysis:
    - [Aerobic Exercise Training Increases Brain Volume in Aging Humans](https://academic.oup.com/biomedgerontology/article/61/11/1166/630432)
  - many reasons for structural brain changes:
    - development/atrophy
    - exercise
    - substance use 
    - inflammation / edema
    - gliosis
    
- fMRI studies
  - spatial resolution: 1-1.5 mm
  - temperal resolution ~0.5 sec
  - no long lasting effects 
  ![](/assets/images/2021-09-21-20-40-23.png)
  - block of epoch design
    - repetitive on and off time
    - simple to design, robust activation due to large number of trials
    - con：
      - assume single mode of activiation at consistant level over repititions
  - event related design
    - pro:
      - flexible analysis
    - con:
      - reduced detection power
      - sensitive errors in hemodynmaic response function 
  - cognitive subtraction
    - assumption: different cognitive components are additive
    - subtract activitation of control task from that of experiment task can isolate effects of that difference in task (taskA-taskB)
    - subtraction is only valid if condition differs in only one property  
      - e.g. **using resting condition as control is bad** 
      - [When zero is not zero: the problem of ambiguous baseline conditions in fMRI](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11592989/)  
      - find face recognition
        ![](/assets/images/2021-09-21-20-53-02.png) 

## Experimental design

technical limitation
  - limited visual field + response options
  - scanner drift - each runs limit to 4-6 min, then restart 
    - longer will cause heat up, change accuracy
  - subject motion: - mm movmement change will interfere 
psychological state

psychological state
  - is the subject effectively engaged?
    - ![](/assets/images/2021-09-23-21-09-19.png)
    - after subject answers, maybe mind drifts off to think about other things 
  - are they using shortcuts to solve the problem?
  - how long does the psychological state last
  - does the task induce unintended psych state?
    - e.g. get anxious or frustrated 
  
statistical design
  - substraction
  - factorial 
    - multiple factors & interaction
      ![](/assets/images/2021-09-23-21-15-15.png)
  - parametic
    - increase levels of difficulty 
  - measure before/after intervention e.g. drug/training/therapy

### Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy

- processions causes a small local magnetic field, opposite direction of static mag field 
- change the local effective mag field, causes resonance frequency to shift "chemical shift"
  - value of the shift gives info about the molecular group of that nucleaus
  - MRS quantify local presence of certain chemical compounds
