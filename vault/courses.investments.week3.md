- Transaction cost:
    - commission/fees to brokerage
    - bid-ask spread:
        - when buying, pay ask price
        - when selling, pay bid price
- overview of individual investor performance

        - in `()` = p value. only stat. significant if < 0.05  
        - average household: benchmarked against simpling holding: no difference 
        - CAPM: no difference
        - 3-factor - alpha also not stat. significant
            - tilt towards value (positive coeff)
            - tilt towards SMB (institutional tend to do more large stock) - which tends to have higher bid-ask spread -> more transaction cost
    - once taken into account of transaction cost, average household under perform against the benchmarks

- loss aversion
    - assymetry:
        - tend to hold on to stock with losses (expected utility of selling is worse than holding)

        - tend to capture gains

    - loss-aversion good or bad?
        - go against **momentum effects**
        - against tax incentives
            - loss aversion effect is stronger in tax-deferred accounts (in regular accounts, the tax incentive reduces the loss aversion effect) - so tax motivation still matters  
    - personal connection to asset
        - emotional connection: house 
        - Genesove and Mayer(2001):
            - if house has fallen value since purchase:
                - takes longer to sell
                - effect 2x for owner-occupants
        - having someone to blame affects trading
            - ![](/assets/images/2020-12-26-16-51-07.png)
            - effect is reversed for mutual funds - loss -> more likely to sell - tax effect more important, easy to blame the fund manager
    -  impact on corporate finance decisions       
        - firm acquisition: 
            - offer's chance of success jumps discontinously when offer price exceeds past 52-week peak
        - equity issuance (sell stock to raise cash):
            - influenced by the stock price when a CEO joined the firm
                -> suggest a firm with past poor stock return may need to fire current CEO if they wish to raise cash by selling equity
    - explanation for momentum?
        - when the stock goes up with good news, the cashing-in effect dampens the initial price increase
        - when stock goes down with bad news, the hold effect dampens initial drop
