Although not deep into any of the topics mentioned, it's a useful survey that gets me started on forming frameworks on how to improve my learning systematically.  


### 4 villans  
- _digital deluge_
    - _小白鼠实验 如果没有downtime 新体验不能激发Neural activity -> long term memory pathway_ 
    - 确实如此 去年第一次请了一天假 agenda就是给自己想清楚自己想做什么 感觉快乐多了 清晰多了
- _digital distraction_
- _digital dementia_
- _digital deduction - let the internet do your thinking and draw your conclusions_
  - 这条非常真实
    - 发现学习最重要的方式是对话，而journaling和写作是一种自己和自己对话的方式

### limitless brain
- _neuroplasticity_
    - London taxi cab study - larger posterior hippocampi 

### reading 
- _pomodoro method_ 
    - 25 min on, 5 min break
    - primacy + recency -> better remembered. the middle tends to forget 
    - more breaks -> more beginnings and endings 

- _FASTER_
    - forget - 放下成见
    - **act**
    - state - energized, curious, excited 
    - **teach** 
    - enter - put onto calendar
    - review - recall 

- _read with **questions** - brain is motivated to find answer_ 
- _what is your dominant question?_
    - _neg example: a people pleaser's dominant question: how do i get people to like me? _
    - _positive example: will smith - how do i make this moment more magical?_ 
    - _what is my doimant question?_
        
### limitless mindset 
steps:
1. name the limiting beliefs 
2. **get to the facts** - when you look at **facts** of what your past actions have resulted, you are usually not as bad at something as you think you are 
3. create a separet persona for the inner critic - make it ugly beast. it's not you

### motivation
- think for self:
  - passions? 
  - purpose? 
  - what am I? identitiy
  - values - a prioritized list 

- when make goals, clear about **reasons** behind it -> deepens commitment

- not saying yes to everything 
  - when you say yes to something, careful you are **not inadvertently saying no to yourself and needs**

- motivate through **pain**: what do you have to lose? 
  "If i don't, I ______" 

#### small simple steps 

Zeigarnik effect - uncompleted tasks created level of tension that keeps task at front of mind until completed 
best way to stop feeling guilty of not getting something done: break small baby steps and get moving towards completion 

#### building habits

- breaking a bad habit is about replacing it with a more constructive habit
- Jim's morning routine：  
   - recall dream
   - make bed
   - drink water
   - brush teeth with left hand 
   - short exercise
   - cold shower 
   - breathing & medidation
   - journal and set agenda for the day 

- my own habit to build in 2022: 
  - [[goals.2022]]

#### Flow 
- key ways to get into flow
  - lack distraction 
  - block of time
  - clarity on goal 
  - should be a little challenging so not bored, but not too challenging. just a little outside 

### Method

#### Concentration
- it's not about mind jumping from place to place. but about awareness
  - need to keep the ball of light shining on the same place 
  - practice when talking, keep mind on conversation
- calming busy mind
  1. breathe: 4-7-8
  2. do something that's been causing you stress
  3. schedule time for distraction 

#### note taking
- note down what hoping to retain, what's important for my goal
- "capture & create"  
  - one side note, one side reactions, creations: how can i use this? why? when? 

### Memory

same stuff as [[books.science.moonwalking-with-Einstein]]

### Speed Reading

- inpediments to speed:
  - regression 
  - subvocalization
- method
  - pacer 
  - exercise
    - same text, reduce the time 
    - perpheral vision 
    - counting while reading (to supress subvocalization)

### Thinking

- 6 thinking hats - Dr edward de bono
  - white: info gather
  - yellow： positives
  - black: difficulties and cons 
  - red: emotion & feelings
  - green: creativeitiy - new ideas, new way of looking at problem 
  - blue: management and organize 

- mental models:
  - 40/70 rule - Colin Power - make a decision with 40% < info < 70%    
  - create a not-to-do list
    - prioiritize todo list
    - be clear about what should't do 
- exponential Thinking
  1. get to underlying probleem
  2. posit new approach
  3. read & research
