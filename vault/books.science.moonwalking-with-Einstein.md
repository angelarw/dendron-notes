Main takeaways:

1. repetition itself does not cause improvement. need to attempt reptition at boundary of ability and consciously focus on the effort to fail less at each rep
2. to make something rememberable is to create as much different connections to things already know - make the concept vivid with all senses: imagery, smell, sound. use mnemonics to make the mental image as jarring and unusual the better.
