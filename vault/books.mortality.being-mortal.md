> "*satisfaction of being a doctor: party from being helpful to others. but also from being* ***technically skilled and able to solve difficult intricate problems***" - so, not so different from many other professions :) 

summarizing Carstensen's study: 
> "*How we seek to spend our time my depend on how much time we perceive ourselves to have... When horizons are measured in decades, which as well be infinity to human beings, you most desire all that stuff at the top of Maslow's pyramid - achivevement, creativity, and other attributes of â€œself-actualization." But as your horizons contract -- when you see the future ahead of you as finite and uncertain -- your focus shifts to the here and now, to everyday pleasures and the people closest to you.*
