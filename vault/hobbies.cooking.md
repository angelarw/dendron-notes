stepsï¼š
1. melt dark cholocate (I steamed it. something like this https://www.thekitchn.com/the-best-way-to-melt-chocolate-alice-medrichs-smart-easy-method-expert-tip-197405 works too)
2. make silken tofu into a paste (you can put the tofu in a plastic bag, cut a tiny opening and squeeze the tofu through. then you can put that tofu through a fine mesh strainer - use the back of a spoon to push it through to the other side then collect it)
3. stir the tofu into melted chocolate, mix well. mix in a few drops of alcohol if you like 
4. find a square container, line the bottom with plastic wrap, put the chocolate mixture in, flatten
5. put in the fridge for an hour
6. take it out, cut it into squares and spread coco powder on it
