### Algorithmic Fairness from a Non-ideal Perspective
- Zack Lipton

- important moments:
    - ProPublica machine bias article from 2016 - a galvanizing event prompting interest: https://www.propublica.org/article/machine-bias-risk-assessments-in-criminal-sentencing 
    - [Gender Shades](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v81/buolamwini18a.html)- 2018. unbalanced dataset of facial benchmarks 
    - biased allocation of healthcare - https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/24/20929337/care-algorithm-study-race-bias-health 
-  Philosophy of justice 
    - https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/justice/
        - obligation ("one's due") in contrast to charity
        - resolve conflicts when interests clash
        - impartiality - two cases relvantly alike should be treated similarly 
    - convservative (conserving existing norms) vs ideal (demand reform of norms and practicies) 
    - corrective (bilateral, wrong-doer <> wronged ) vs distributive (allocating goods to individuals, mutltilateral with a distributing agent)
    - procedural (procedure) vs substantive (end result)
    - comparative (a position was offered to a less qualified candidate) vs non-comparative (regardless of comparison, e.g. basic human rights)
        - ML disccussion often focus on comparative. should also consider non-comparative
    - scope of justice 
    - ideal and non-ideal theorizing (The Imperative of Integration - Elizabeth S. Anderson)
        - ideal:
            - imagine perfectly just world  (Rawls)
            - try to minimzie discrepancy between reality and ideal
            - e.g. been used to argue against affirmative acction - ideal world is color blind 
        - non-ideal:
            - understand causual explanation of the problem, determine waht can be done and who to correct it. 
        
- economics 
    - "the economics of discrimination" - Becker 
        -  simulation of employer taste-based discrimination-> equilibrium to 
    - Arrow's Rebuttal to Becker 1973 
        - imperfect information as alternative cause 
    - "Statistical theory of racism and sexism"
