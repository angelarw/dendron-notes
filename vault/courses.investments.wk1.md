## Foundamentals review
### Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)

Excess return of a stock is proportional to its beta

 \\( \beta \\): covariance - systemtic risk - sensitivity to the market

- \\( \beta \\) = 1, stock moves with the market exactly
- \\( \beta \\) > 1, stock amplifies market
- 0 < \\( \beta \\) < 1, goes with market, but less so, e.g. Walmart 

Stadard deviation (\\(\sigma\\)): measure of total risk  

CAPM: assets with higher \\( \beta \\) should have higher benchmarks. Can't sipmly compare returns of assets. Prices and expected returns should reflect how sensitive it is to overall market 

Alpha (\\(\alpha)\\): performance of an asset relative to its CAPM predicte return.

 asset 1 less beta than market but still same return - better 

 ### 3-Factor model 

In reality, \\( \beta \\) generally does not predict returns as strongly as CAPM. Other factors that predict returns.

- firm size
    - small firm outperform large  
- famous value premium
    - "value stock" have historically outperformed (vs. "growth stock")
    - high book/market ratio - value stock

augmenting CAPM:

### Market efficiency 
![](/assets/images/2020-12-19-16-22-11.png)

Interpretation of market anomalies:
- risk
- irrational behavior 
- data mining - coincidentally fit the pattern 

Efficieint Market Hypothesis (EMH)
- Semi-strong form EMH: stock prices reflect all publically available information 

### Regression 
![](/assets/images/2020-12-19-16-55-56.png)

- p-value: prob. of finding the observed coefficient estimate under the null hypothesis
    - common cutoff: 0.05 or smaller 
- statistical significance: 5% means p value is less than 0.05 
- t-statistic: ratio of coefficient to the standard error of the coefficient 
    - common cutoff: 2 or more 
- (\\(r^2)\\)- goodness of fit. how much of variability of dependent variable is explained by independent variable ( 0= no relation  1= fit perfectly)


## Compositions of Returns


### Realization-based capital gains tax
- realize loss within a year. so deduction is valued at regular income tax 
    - realize before 12/31 
- realize gain after a year
    - postpose after 12/31 so tax is delayed for next year
- Tax delayed = tax saved 
    - example: if asset is 10% return, 20% cap gain tax, sell after 10 years -> equivalent annual tax rate = 14.3%

- basis step-up at death - when inheriting, basis step-up so cap gain tax is minimized
