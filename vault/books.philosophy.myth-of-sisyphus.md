## An Absurd Reasoning
### Absurdity and Suicide 

"There is but one truly serious philosophical problem, and that is suicide"
- why? because the consequence of the conclusion > any other question
- Real question is: **Does the Absurd dictate death？**

### Absurd walls 

world in itself is not absurd, what's absurd is the confrontation between man's urge towards unity and things that can't be reconcilled:
- pure reason is full of paradoxes (e.g. Aristotle's about truths and falses)
- Science behind what we see/touch: all just hypothesis, impossible to know for sure
- in this age, lots of critism of rationalism. further proves the intensity of the hope of reconciliation and its futility 

### Philosophical suicide

- absurd is result of comparison. magnitutde of absurdity proportional to distance of the two 
- other existential philosophers: escape 
  - Jaspers: the absurd itself is transcendence - it's a leap 
  - Chstov: god is the solution 
  - Kierkergaard: 
    - "The important thing is not to be cured, but to live with one's ailments. Kierkergaard watns to be cured".
    - for K, dispair is sin, sin is waht alientates from god 

### Absurd freedom

- Facts I cannot deny: the desire for unity, the longing to solve, the need for clarity and cohesion
- The certainties: my appepite for the abolut and for unity and the impossiblity of reducing this world to a rational and reasonable principle 
- suicide: 
  - similar to philosohpical suicide, is escaping from the problem 
  - living is keeping the absurd alive. in that consciousneess and day-to-day revolt man give proof of his only truth - defiance 
- freedom 
  - before encountering absurd, everyday man lives with goals and concern for future
  - but no true freedom exist if if it's not eternal 
  - if man imagine a purpose to his life, he becomes slave to the demands of the purpose - you are free to choose, but if you choose, you are no longer free 
  

### Myth of sisyphus

"Each atom of that stone, each mineral flake of that night-filled mountain, in itself forms a world. The struggle itself toward the heights is enough to fill a man’s heart. One must imagine Sisyphus happy"
