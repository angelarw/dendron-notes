    - **Assume**: censoring is non-informative - being censored or not is not related to the probablity of event happening
- [Survival Analysis Part 2 | Survival Function, Hazard, & Hazard Ratio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdmWdIV5k-I)
    - **Survival function**: S(t) = P(T>t) = prob. of survival beyond time t
    - **Hazard**: HAZ = P(T< t + dt | T >t)
             = prob of dying in next few seconds, given alive now
    - Hazard ratio (HR) = HAZ, x=1 / HAZ, x=0
