## Methods of Communication in the Brain

- reticular 网状 theory (Golgi)
  - connected reticular net 
- neuron doctrine
  - neurons are independent, contigual not continual 
- types:
  - sensory neuron - external stimuli -> electrical signals
  - interneuron - processing & relay
  - motor neuron - electrical signals-> muscle or gland movement
- ion channels & ion pumps 
  - ![](/assets/images/2021-09-09-12-54-33.png)
  1. influx of Ca++ -> synaptic vesicles fuse with pre-synaptic membrane
  1. transmitter released into cleft
  1. transmitter binds receptor molecules on post-synaptic membrane
  1. post-synaptic channels then open/close based on binding
  1. opneing -> influx of ions (Na+/K+) / close -> prevents
  1. causes either depolarize or hyper-polarize 
  1. if post-synaptic voltage large enough -> electrochemical pual is generated = action potential
  1. simultaneously
      - action potential travels down axon. 
      - used vesicle is retrieved and recycled
  1. new transmitter is synthesized 

  - ![](/assets/images/2021-09-09-12-55-57.png)
  - Excitatory post-synaptic potential (EPSP)
    - sometimes sum of EPSPs from multiple neuros are necessary for action potential

  - recording 
    - ![](/assets/images/2021-09-09-13-04-08.png)
    - inside neuron (1)
    - outside neuron (2)
      - extracellular eletrode can only measure local neuronal environment (local field potential LFP)
- different neurotransmitters (>50)
  - by makeup
    - amino acids
      - glutamate
      - aspartate
      - glycine
      ...
    - peptides
      - somatostatin
      ...
    - others 
      - Serotonin 血清素
      - Histamine 组胺
      - Melatonin 褪黑素
      - Norepinephrine 去甲肾上腺素
  - by excitatory vs inhibooary
    - excitatory 
      - epinephrine 肾上腺素
      - norepinephrine
    - inhibitory
      - serotonin
      - GABA
    - both
      - dopamine
  - important examples
    - acetylcholine 乙酰胆碱
      - excitatory 
      - activates motor neurons
      - attention, arounsal, learning, memory
      - low levels in Alzheimers
    - dopamine
      - fine movements
      - positive emotions
      - abnorally low levels in Parkinsons
      - abnorally high in frontal areas of schizophrenia
    - glutamate 穀氨酸
      - most commonly found
      - learning & memory
      - execessive production is toxic (ALS)
      - binds to AMPA, open, allow Na+ in
      - binds to NMDA, open, allow Ca++ in

    - corticospinal tracts
      
      ![](/assets/images/2021-09-09-13-41-42.png)
  - through hormones in vascular system
    - brain is neurochemically protected by BBB **blood-brain barrier**
      - ![](/assets/images/2021-09-09-13-46-06.png)
      - endothelial cells line blood vessels
      - needed material is actively transported, like glucose
      - only small hydrophobic molecules e.g. O2 are allowed through
      - prevents toxins, bacateria, etc. 
    - parts not protected by BBB：
      - hypothalamus 下丘脑
      - pituitary 脑下垂体
      - pineal glands 松果体
      - regulates temperature, thirst, hunger, circadian rhythm, sleep, stress response, etc. 
    - bi-directional 
      - e.g. adrenaline/epinephrine
        - through blood, activates sympathetic nervous system 交感神经: fight/flight responses
        - binds to receptors on vagal nerve -> releases glutamate -> encode the event to remember for future
