## Anatomy
- Neurons 神经元细胞
  - ![](/assets/images/2021-09-09-09-38-10.png)
  - Axon: transmits electrical signal 轴突
  - axon terminal: = presynaptic terminal, end on adjoining dendrites or cell body
  - Dendrites: receives contact 树突
- Glia  神经胶质细胞
  - majority of cells 
  - function
    - connective tissue
    - metabolic support roles
    - remove excessive secretions
    - produces myelin=insulates neurons
- Structural anatomy
  - cytoarchitectural organization
  - dissociable brain structure 
  - dissociable brain networks
  - rudimental classification

  - in MRI
    - coronal = frontal
    - axial - transverse
    - sagittal
    
    ![](/assets/images/2021-09-09-11-48-41.png)
    - left vs right in frontal view 
      - radiological convention: left on right side of image
        - face forward
      - neurological convention: left is left in image
        - face backward
    - use fiduciary marker - right side

- proximal 近vs distal
- ipsilateral 同側vs contralateral 異側

## Methods of Communication in the Brain

- reticular 网状 theory (Golgi)
  - connected reticular net 
- neuron doctrine
  - neurons are independent, contigual not continual 
- types:
  - sensory neuron - external stimuli -> electrical signals
  - interneuron - processing & relay
  - motor neuron - electrical signals-> muscle or gland movement
- ion channels & ion pumps 
  - ![](/assets/images/2021-09-09-12-54-33.png)
  1. influx of Ca++ -> synaptic vesicles fuse with pre-synaptic membrane
  1. transmitter released into cleft
  1. transmitter binds receptor molecules on post-synaptic membrane
  1. post-synaptic channels then open/close based on binding
  1. opneing -> influx of ions (Na+/K+) / close -> prevents
  1. causes either depolarize or hyper-polarize 
  1. if post-synaptic voltage large enough -> electrochemical pual is generated = action potential
  1. simultaneously
      - action potential travels down axon. 
      - used vesicle is retrieved and recycled
  1. new transmitter is synthesized 

  - ![](/assets/images/2021-09-09-12-55-57.png)
  - Excitatory post-synaptic potential (EPSP)
    - sometimes sum of EPSPs from multiple neuros are necessary for action potential

  - recording 
    - ![](/assets/images/2021-09-09-13-04-08.png)
    - inside neuron (1)
    - outside neuron (2)
      - extracellular eletrode can only measure local neuronal environment (local field potential LFP)
- different neurotransmitters (>50)
  - by makeup
    - amino acids
      - glutamate
      - aspartate
      - glycine
      ...
    - peptides
      - somatostatin
      ...
    - others 
      - Serotonin 血清素
      - Histamine 组胺
      - Melatonin 褪黑素
      - Norepinephrine 去甲肾上腺素
  - by excitatory vs inhibooary
    - excitatory 
      - epinephrine 肾上腺素
      - norepinephrine
    - inhibitory
      - serotonin
      - GABA
    - both
      - dopamine
  - important examples
    - acetylcholine 乙酰胆碱
      - excitatory 
      - activates motor neurons
      - attention, arounsal, learning, memory
      - low levels in Alzheimers
    - dopamine
      - fine movements
      - positive emotions
      - abnorally low levels in Parkinsons
      - abnorally high in frontal areas of schizophrenia
    - glutamate 穀氨酸
      - most commonly found
      - learning & memory
      - execessive production is toxic (ALS)
      - binds to AMPA, open, allow Na+ in
      - binds to NMDA, open, allow Ca++ in
      - ![](/assets/images/2021-09-09-13-33-16.png)
  - different receptor react to different neurotransmitters 
    - ![](/assets/images/2021-09-09-13-34-11.png)
    - agonist 激动剂
    - competitive antagonist - blocks other agonist from binding
    - non-competitive antagonist - different site 
- interaction with body
  - direct innvervation through spinal cord + peripheral nerve system 
    - cranial nerves
      
      ![](/assets/images/2021-09-09-13-41-15.png)
    - corticospinal tracts
      
      ![](/assets/images/2021-09-09-13-41-42.png)
  - through hormones in vascular system
    - brain is neurochemically protected by BBB **blood-brain barrier**
      - ![](/assets/images/2021-09-09-13-46-06.png)
      - endothelial cells line blood vessels
      - needed material is actively transported, like glucose
      - only small hydrophobic molecules e.g. O2 are allowed through
      - prevents toxins, bacateria, etc. 
    - parts not protected by BBB：
      - hypothalamus 下丘脑
      - pituitary 脑下垂体
      - pineal glands 松果体
      - regulates temperature, thirst, hunger, circadian rhythm, sleep, stress response, etc. 
    - bi-directional 
      - e.g. adrenaline/epinephrine
        - through blood, activates sympathetic nervous system 交感神经: fight/flight responses
        - binds to receptors on vagal nerve -> releases glutamate -> encode the event to remember for future
